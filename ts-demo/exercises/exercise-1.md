# Exercise 1

1. Copy the Tiny CLI code from [Node.js Readline documenation](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#example-tiny-cli) into a file named `cli.js`. 

2. Update the TypeScript configuration file to enable JavaScript and implicit any. Build the CLI code and run it. Does it work?

3. Update the TypeScript configuration file to not allow JavaScript. Build and run the code again. Any problems? Make the needed fixes (if any) to build the CLI and run the code.

4. Update the TypeScript configuration file to disable implicit any. Build and run the CLI. Any problems? Make any needed fixes.

5. Reflect on how plain JavaScript was incrementally upgraded to TypeScript.
